# Polygon ME

Polygon ME are customizable and composable ERC-721 NFTs. Once registered you'll be able to add details to your account, even a custom vector image.

NFTs are completely on-chain, which means they're served as vector image (.svg) directly from blockchain.

You can ask to add a TLD for your project or your corporate, to personalize even more the names.
